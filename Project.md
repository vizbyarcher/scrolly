# Atlas of Leadership - Project Description

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Atlas of Leadership: Navigating Academic Legacies, Gender and Generations  
**Author:** Edit Gyenge  
**Project Type:** Interactive Data Journalism / Scrollytelling Application  
**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Atlas of Leadership is an interactive scrollytelling web application that visualizes global political leadership through the lens of academic background, gender representation, and generational distribution. The project presents data on current heads of state from around the world, mapping them geographically on an interactive 3D globe while encoding multiple data dimensions through a custom visual language of colored, petal-shaped markers.

The application combines data journalism with interactive cartography to tell a narrative story about world leadership demographics, allowing users to explore patterns in education, gender balance, and generational shifts across different continents and regions.

## Core Concept & User Experience

### Narrative Structure

The application follows a scrollytelling format where the user scrolls vertically through a linear narrative. As the user scrolls:

- Text content fades in and out, presenting different sections of the story
- The background map globe rotates and zooms to focus on relevant geographic regions
- Leader markers become highlighted or dimmed based on the current narrative focus
- Statistical insights and patterns are revealed progressively

### Visual Encoding System

Each world leader is represented by a custom circular marker with the following encoding:

1. **Color** - Represents the leader's academic field of graduation:
   - Yellow/Orange: Humanities and social sciences (history, arts, etc.)
   - Green: Natural sciences (biology, physics, etc.)
   - Cyan/Turquoise: Formal sciences (mathematics, statistics, etc.)
   - Purple: Professions and applied sciences (law, medicine, etc.)
   - Gray: No university diploma / No data available
   - Gradient of 2+ colors: Multiple academic fields

2. **Number of Petals** - Represents the leader's generation:
   - 4 petals: Silent Generation (1928-1945)
   - 3 petals: Baby Boomers (1946-1964)
   - 2 petals: Generation X (1965-1980)
   - 1 petal: Generation Y - Millennials (1981-1996)

3. **Orientation** - Represents gender:
   - Upward pointing: Male
   - Downward pointing: Female

4. **Position** - Geographic location (leader's country)

5. **Portrait** - Actual photograph of the leader within the marker

### User Interactions

Users can interact with the application in three primary ways:

1. **Scrolling**: Primary navigation method that advances the narrative and triggers map transformations
2. **Map Pan/Swipe**: Left/right swiping to manually explore the globe
3. **Zoom**: Pinch-to-zoom or scroll wheel to zoom in/out on the map
4. **Click/Tap**: Click on individual leader markers to view detailed information (tooltip/modal)

## Data Quality Considerations

### Special Cases Noted

From the visible notes in the screenshots:

1. **Afghanistan:** "Head of state's year of birth is approximate, there is no clear data available"

2. **Bosnia and Herzegovina:** "The presidency is a three-member body, one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat, which collectively serves. Although the unsubdivided body is the collective head of state, one member is designated as Chairperson of the Presidency around the three members every eight months, with the candidate receiving the most votes overall becoming the first Chairperson over the four-year term."

These special cases require:
- Flexible data schema to handle exceptions
- Additional notes field for context
- UI considerations for displaying complex governance structures
- Data validation rules that can accommodate edge cases

### Data Validation Requirements

- Verify all coordinates are valid lat/lng pairs
- Ensure birth years fall within reasonable ranges
- Check that all referenced portrait images exist
- Validate university names against a canonical list
- Confirm educational field mappings are consistent
- Handle missing data gracefully (null/undefined values)

## Accessibility Considerations

For an inclusive user experience:

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Allow scrolling with keyboard (arrow keys, page up/down)
   - Tab through interactive elements (leader markers)
   - Keyboard-accessible map controls

2. **Screen Reader Support:**
   - Alt text for all images and portraits
   - ARIA labels for custom markers
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Text alternatives for visual-only information

3. **Color Contrast:**
   - Ensure text overlays have sufficient contrast
   - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
   - Consider colorblind-friendly palette

4. **Motion & Animation:**
   - Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
   - Provide option to disable automatic map animations
   - Smooth but not overly fast transitions

## Key Takeaways for Developers

When building or maintaining this project:

1. **Data is Central:** The quality and accuracy of leader data determines the entire application's value. Invest in data validation and update workflows.

2. **Performance Matters:** With complex 3D rendering and many markers, optimization is not optional. Profile regularly and optimize bottlenecks.

3. **Storytelling First:** The scrollytelling narrative drives everything. Map animations and transitions should serve the story, not distract from it.

4. **Custom Visuals Require Care:** The petal marker system is unique and memorable, but requires precise implementation to look professional at all sizes.

5. **Accessibility is Essential:** Data journalism should be accessible to all audiences. Don't sacrifice accessibility for visual flair.

6. **Test Across Devices:** What works on a desktop with a mouse may not work on a phone with touch. Design for all input methods.

7. **Document Everything:** Future maintainers (including yourself) will thank you for clear documentation of data structures, animation timings, and architectural decisions.
